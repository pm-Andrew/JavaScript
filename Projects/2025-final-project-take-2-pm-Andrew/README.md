# CTEC 126 - Final Project

Updated for Spring 2025

## Overview

This assignment will have you develop a web page that displays news stories from the New York Times. The stories will be retrieved using JavaScript fetch() (AJAX) calls to the application programming interface (API) provided by the New York Times.

- [x] Your page must allow users to display news from the following sections from the Top Stories API:

- Home (the default news displayed when the page is first loaded)
- Arts
- Business
- Dining
- Fashion
- Health Magazine
- National Opinion
- Politics
- Real Estate
- Science
- Sports
- Technology
- World

## Getting an API Key

- You will need an API key to communicate with the API.
- Use the page in Canvas to obtain your API key.

1. A folder named **test-api-key** with a file called **test_api_key.html** that includes some straightforward JavaScript has been provided to help you test your key. Look for the place in the code where you can insert your API key.

2. Test your API key. If it's not working, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

3. Now that you have your API key and have tested it, you can start coding.

## Assignment Details

- [x]Your page must show all of the stories returned from the API.
- [x] An HTML ```<select>``` control should allow a person to select the news section they want to retrieve stories from.
- [x] The stories should be loaded on page load.
- [x] When the user selects another news section, only the stories section of the page should reload. The entire page MUST NOT reload.

  - One of the multimedia images for the news story
- [x]All of the news stories should be displayed using a "card" styling
- [x] All of your JavaScript code must be in the **js/nyt.js** file
- [x] Your page needs to be professionally styled using the nyt.css stylesheet. This will count for 40% of this project's grade.
-  Your HTML and CSS must validate
- You must record a video showing off your work and code
- You must not have any WAVE errors, alerts or contrast errors
